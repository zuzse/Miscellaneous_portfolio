### **SQL Covid project**

In this project I used publicly available data set on Covid to showcase different SQL queries. 
I am performing data exploration on covid cases within European countries as well as comparison of Scandinavia (as I currently live in Sweden) with Visegrad roup (as I come from Slovakia).
The aim was to show usage of JOINS, CTEs, Nested queries and Temporary tables and thus, the analysis doesnâ€™t tell a specific story :-)
